/* As I did my program, I had the help and support of various resources and collaborations. I used LLMS to guide and better my understanding
during this process. They provided valuable assitance in coding practices and especially problem solving strategies. 

Some External References I used: C++ Mini Project on Task Manager. Started from scratch to build C++ projects which covered topics like classes. 
Also used GeeksforGeeks website which helped me in structureing task management features for this project. Lastly, I used the most important
which was youtube. Tutorial videos that helped with the development of this project and also gave me practical examples and explanations.

I had discussions with peers to help me understand a bit more of what was needed. 
Mikayla, my classmate who gave ms ideas and troublshoot various aspects of the program when it didn't want to run well on Visual Studio.
Leonidez, a bachelor student who provided me insight into how to go about starting my program, and helped me set up repository for Github.
